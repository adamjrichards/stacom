	<h2>Andrea Charendoff, RP, DTATI, BA, BSc.</h2>
	<p class="editable">I entered the field of art therapy in mid-life, motivated by a strong passion to promote healing through art.  As a long-time professional artist, I am keenly aware of the potential for self-expression during the creative process.  Over the course of my life, I have also come to understand the healing nature of art-making, and the powerful ways in which it can ease emotional pain, relieve stress, reveal otherwise hidden information about one&#x0027;s true personality, and provide a sense of well-being and joy.</p>
	<p class="editable">I am a registered psychotherapist with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario. I obtained a masters&#x0027;s-level diploma from the Toronto Art Therapy Institute in Toronto, Ontario.  I am an insured, professional member of the Canadian Art Therapy Association, and a member of the Ontario Association of Consultants, Counsellors, Psychometrists and Psychotherapists.</p>
	<p class="editable">I completed a pilot study for my thesis (2012) on the use of art therapy with adults who have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADHD), entitled &ldquo;How Do Adults with ADHD Experience the Creative Process in Art Therapy?&rdquo; I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Occupational Therapy from the University of Toronto in 1985, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from York University in 1981.</p>
	<p class="editable">I have experience working with people of all ages: young adults with eating disorders; adults with substance abuse/addiction issues; adults with ADHD; children with severe emotional issues, psychological disorders and behavioral problems (including ADHD); and elderly people with varying levels of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and depression.</p>
	<p class="editable">As a professional artist, I have exhibited at national and regional art shows since 1998.</p>
