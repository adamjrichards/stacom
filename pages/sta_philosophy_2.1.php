	<h2>The Philosophy behind Art Therapy and My Practice</h2>
	<p>I believe in a client-centered approach to therapy, based on each client&apos;s individual needs and characteristics.</p>
	<p>I am committed to providing a therapeutic environment that is safe, non-judgmental, compassionate, and supportive.</p>
	<p>All sessions are confidential. There are a small number of exceptions to the confidentiality policy, such as life or death situations, concern for self-harm or harm to others, court mandates, etc. Confidentiality will be discussed further in the initial session.</p>
	<p>Artwork created in therapy sessions is also confidential. It belongs to you, and can be stored safely in a locked location or taken home by you at any time.</p>
	<p>The use of art as a means of communication is common to all cultures, and can be considered a &ldquo;visual voice&rdquo; that is available to everyone.</p>
